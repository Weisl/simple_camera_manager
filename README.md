Cam-Manager is an add-on to improve efficiency and organization with multiple cameras. It empowers you to quickly present your work from product design to modeling/texturing work. It is a powerful tool to tweak the composition and framing of your artwork or when working with image planes. The addon includes different overview panels (3D view and Scene properties), a pie menu for quickly adjusting settings on the active camera, different tools to assign and adjust camera-specific resolution, world materials, render slots, and more. Further, it allows you to customize the shortcuts to your needs.
>⚠️
**This addon does not provide special tools for animation.** It is designed for static cameras, working with image planes, setting up the framing and composition as well as quickly presenting your work with static images.
